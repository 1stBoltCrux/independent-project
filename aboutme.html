              <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
              <p>My name is Ted Leary. I have recently started a coding program at Epicodus in downtown Portland. I am a 29 year old Florida native who six years ago decided to up and move to the great state of Oregon.</p>

              <h2>My Background</h2>
              <p>I graduated from the University of Central Florida with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Drawing and Painting in 2011. After finishing school I moved onto a career in service and bartending. I have also worked periodically on habitat restoration teams in both the United States and New Zealand.</p>
              <p>I left the U.S. for a year and during that time I decided that I was looking to change up my career upon returning home. Two weeks after stepping off the plane I started learning to code at Epicodus.</p>
